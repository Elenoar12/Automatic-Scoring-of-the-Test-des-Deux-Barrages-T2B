# Automatic-Scoring-of-the-Test-des-Deux-Barrages-T2B

Paper-pencil tests are essential tools in neuropsychology to quantify effects of a disease on cognitive performance. The evaluation of these tests is mostly done manually, which is time-consuming and prone to errors. This thesis proposes an automatic scoring system for the Test des Deux Barrages, a selective attention test regularly used in Switzerland. The goal of the thesis was to investigate the number of errors made in the evaluation and to develop a scoring system that would deliver results similar to the manual evaluation by clinical experts. 
For this purpose, 23 filled-out test sheets and their evaluations by clinical experts were collected. The clinical evaluations were examined for errors using the ground truth of the patients. The collected test sheets were split into individual symbols and the symbols classified as marked by the patient or not based on their grayscale values. Three models were developed for binary classification. The performance of the models was evaluated on various performance metrics (balanced accuracy, F1 measure, sensitivity and specificity) and compared to the performance of clinical experts using the sign test and Wilcoxon signed-rank test.
